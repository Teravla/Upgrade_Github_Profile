## Create your personal Readme.md 

Let's see how to create a very attractive profile page

1. Create a repository named: `username/username`. Github will automatically tell you that this is a special repo.

2. Talk about yourself, put emotes, links, ... It's Markdown, so knock yourself out. You can also add gifs, animated emotes. Anything goes. If you browse github and find some nuggets, you can recover the resources by forking the user's Readme.md *(The author disclaims all responsibility)*.

### Create a metric 

A metric is like a quick summary of your github account. To create one, simply visit the [official metrics repository](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics?tab=readme-ov-file) and follow the [tutorial](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics?tab=readme-ov-file#-setup). 

### Create a Wakapi profile

Wakapi lets you create a summary of your coding sessions on your favorite IDE. 
To take advantage of this wonderful tool, go to [Wakapi.dev](https://wakapi.dev) and follow the procedure. 

Once everything is set up, you can go to **Parameters -> Integrations** and retrieve a code at the bottom that you'll just need to put in your Github profile Readme.md and you're all set.
